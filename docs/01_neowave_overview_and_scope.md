1. Fundamentals of NEoWave Theory

Fractal Wave Hierarchy: Markets are structured fractally into waves of varying degree. The smallest fundamental unit is the Monowave – a single directional price movement (up or down). Larger patterns (Polywaves) form when monowaves connect into segments and higher-degree structures
litefinance.org
neowave.com
. Each wave is labeled by degree (e.g., Minor, Intermediate, Primary) such that adjacent waves of the same degree exhibit comparable magnitude and duration. Under Neely’s Rule of Similarity and Balance, the smaller of two adjacent same-degree waves should cover at least 1/3 the price range and 1/3 the time of the larger wave
neowave.com
. If neither price nor time satisfies this ~33% threshold, the waves are unlikely to be of equal degree
neowave.com
. This rule standardizes degree labeling and ensures a consistent fractal scaling of waves.

Chart Construction & Time-Frame Normalization: Neely emphasizes rigorous charting standards to reduce subjectivity. Price charts should begin at a clear extremum (all-time high/low or start of a major cycle) and use non-expiring continuous data
neowavechart.com
neowave.com
. The time axis is normalized such that waves are analyzed in a consistent frame (e.g., using daily charts for intermediate waves, weekly for primary). Monowave identification is critical: swing highs and lows are first detected to segment the price action into directional waves. This often involves filtering out minor “noise” oscillations below a certain percentage or time threshold so that only meaningful monowaves remain. Neely’s method advocates using cash (spot) price data (no futures roll gaps) and constant time intervals, ensuring that equal degrees have similar opportunity to develop
neowavechart.com
neowave.com
. By controlling how charts are drawn and using a proper starting point, one creates a consistent basis for applying wave rules.

Polywave Structure Labels: Each polywave pattern is described by a standardized label indicating its internal structure. For example, “:5” denotes a motive (impulse) segment composed of five sub-waves, while “:3” denotes a corrective segment composed of three sub-waves
litefinance.org
. Compound labels like “x:c3” indicate a corrective (3-wave) structure acting as a connecting x wave
litefinance.org
. Waves are labeled with numbers for impulses (1–5) and letters for corrections (A, B, C, D, E) across degrees. Neely introduced explicit notation to mark pattern positions (e.g., “:L3” for the last three in a pattern, “:F3” for a flat’s first corrective phase)
litefinance.org
litefinance.org
. This labeling schema is part of NEoWave’s formalization, ensuring each segment’s role is clear (motive vs corrective, initial vs terminal, etc.), which aids algorithmic parsing of wave structures.

2. Impulse (Motive) Wave Rules and Structure

An Impulse pattern (also called a 5-wave motive wave) drives the market strongly in one direction and is labeled 1-2-3-4-5. NEoWave refines the classic Elliott impulse with stricter numeric thresholds and logical conditions:

Basic Impulse Definition: A valid impulse has five distinct waves with three waves (1, 3, 5) progressing in the trend direction and two counter-trend corrections (2, 4)
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Waves 2 and 4 are alternating corrections separating the trending waves. If any of the standard impulse rules is violated, the formation is not an impulse but a correction
scribd.com
litefinance.org
.

Wave 1: By definition, the first wave sets the trend direction. NEoWave doesn’t impose a specific minimum length on wave 1, but it must establish a clear swing. Invalidation: If wave 1 itself subdivides into 3 (corrective structure) rather than 5, then the supposed impulse start is questionable
litefinance.org
litefinance.org
. Wave 1 also should not be too small relative to subsequent waves – if it is less than ~1/3 the size of wave 3 or 5, degree labeling might be wrong
neowave.com
. There is no overlap or retracement concern yet, as wave 1 has no preceding wave.

Wave 2: This is the first corrective phase against wave 1. Price Rule: Wave 2 must not retrace 100% of wave 1 – in other words, it cannot return to the origin of wave 1
scribd.com
scribd.com
. The maximum typical retracement is 61.8% of wave 1 under NEoWave’s retracement guidelines for a healthy impulse
wavesstrategy.com
, though up to ~99% is allowable (beyond that the wave-1 starting level is breached, invalidating the impulse count). Time Rule: Wave 2 should typically take more time than wave 1 took (NEoWave discourages disproportionately fast wave-2 corrections), but must consume less time than wave 1 plus wave 3 combined – otherwise it would likely be a higher-degree pattern. Invalidation: Any drop at or beyond wave 1’s start makes the structure corrective (not an impulse)
scribd.com
.

Wave 3: This wave is nearly always the longest and strongest wave in an impulse. Length Rule: Wave 3 must be longer than wave 2 in price magnitude
scribd.com
, and cannot be the shortest among waves 1, 3, 5
scribd.com
. In practice, wave 3 usually exceeds wave 1 by at least 1.0x to 1.618x or more. NEoWave’s Extension Rule formalizes this: an impulse must contain an extended wave that is at least 161.8% the length of the next-longest wave
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If no wave reaches 1.618× another, the pattern is likely a correction masquerading as an impulse. Extension & Exceptions: Commonly wave 3 is the extended wave. If wave 3 is the longest but <161.8% of wave 1, and wave 5 is shorter than wave 3, an extremely rare 3rd-wave extension terminal impulse is still possible
scribd.com
. Conversely, if wave 1 is longest but slightly under 161.8% of wave 3, and wave 3’s end stays within 61.8% beyond wave 1’s end, a rare impulse variant can occur
scribd.com
. Outside these exceptions, failure to have a ≥161.8% extension invalidates the impulse count
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Volume: Wave 3 often shows the greatest volume surge. In a textbook impulse, volume should expand significantly during wave 3’s rally/decline, confirming its strength. A weak volume on a price-extending wave 3 would be a red flag (possible diagonal or correction instead).

Wave 4: The second corrective phase. Overlap Rule: In a normal trending impulse, wave 4’s price territory must not overlap into wave 1 (i.e., wave 4 should not fall into the range of wave 1, in a bull trend)
scribd.com
. If waves 2 and 4 do overlap, then the impulse is classified as a Terminal pattern (ending diagonal) rather than a standard trending impulse
scribd.com
. Neely distinguishes these: a Trending impulse has no overlap and typically occurs as wave 1 or 3 of a larger degree; a Terminal impulse (ending diagonal) allows overlap of wave 4 over wave 2’s price but comes with special constraints (usually in 5th or C-wave positions). Alternation: According to the Rule of Alternation, wave 4 tends to differ in form from wave 2
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If wave 2 was a sharp simple correction (zigzag), wave 4 is likely a sideways complex (flat or triangle), and vice versa. NEoWave extends this concept with a Reverse Alternation insight: in rare cases (particularly in certain triangles or diametric patterns), the usual alternation of complexity can invert. For example, in a contracting triangle with reverse alternation, wave-D can be more complex or time-consuming than wave-B (unlike the norm)
neowave.com
neowave.com
. Wave 4’s time should be proportional as well – often longer than wave 2 if wave 2 was sharp, but it must not consume so much time that it invalidates degree parity (e.g., wave 4 taking vastly more time than wave 3 did is suspect). Volume: Typically lower volume in wave 4 compared to wave 3; diminishing volume in wave 4 (especially if it forms a triangle) is common.

Wave 5: The final motive wave. Length/Failure Rule: Wave 5 is “almost always” longer than wave 4 (in price length) and must reach at least 38.2% of wave 4’s length
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If wave 5 falls between 38.2% and 100% of wave 4, it is considered a failed fifth (truncated impulse)
scribd.com
. A failure means wave 5 did not extend beyond wave 3’s end (in a bull market, price high of wave 5 remains below wave 3’s peak) – an allowable but relatively rare outcome indicating market exhaustion. If wave 5 is <38.2% of wave 4, the impulse structure is likely invalid (or the wave in question is not wave 5). Volume and Termination: In a healthy trend, wave 5 may exhibit divergence – i.e., price makes a new extreme with lower momentum or volume than wave 3. Volume often tapers off in wave 5 (unless wave 5 extends dramatically). A classic sign of termination is reduced volume on wave 5 and failure to significantly exceed wave 3’s price, signaling trend exhaustion. Invalidation: If wave 5 reverses and fully retraces more than 100% of wave 4 in faster time than wave 5 took to form, it suggests wave 5 (and thus the impulse) had already ended and a new phase started – effectively confirming the end of the impulse.

Overall Impulse Characteristics: At least one wave (usually wave 3) must be extended (longest by >=61.8%)
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Fibonacci Proportions are often present: common relationships include wave 3 ≈ 1.618× wave 1; wave 5 ≈ 0.618× wave 3 (if wave1 extended) or ≈ wave1 length (if wave3 extended). NEoWave formalizes these more strictly as requirements or strong expectations rather than loose guidelines. Channeling: Instead of standard Elliott channels, NEoWave uses dynamic channeling. After waves 1-2-3-4, an “adjusted channel” is drawn through the end of wave 2 and wave 4; wave 3 is placed parallel from wave 2. The completion of wave 4 allows a channel that often projects wave 5’s end
litefinance.org
litefinance.org
. Neely’s NEoWave Channeling technique provides an objective way to confirm impulse completion: if wave 5 exits the channel and then the subsequent reaction falls back inside the channel in less time than wave 5 took, the impulse is done
litefinance.org
litefinance.org
.

Invalidation Summary: NEoWave defines clear cut-offs that falsify an impulse count. Key invalidation criteria include: Wave 2 retracing 100% of Wave 1
scribd.com
; Wave 3 being shorter than either Wave 1 or Wave 5
scribd.com
; Wave 4 entering territory of Wave 1 in a supposed trending impulse
scribd.com
; or failure of any wave to extend 1.618× another (barring special terminal cases)
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If any one of the impulse rules is not met, Neely insists the formation is likely a correction, not a true impulse
scribd.com
. This strong falsification principle ensures that an algorithm can definitively rule out impulsive counts early, forcing a corrective interpretation in borderline cases
scribd.com
litefinance.org
.

Terminal Impulse Specifics: NEoWave broadens impulses to include “terminal” patterns (diagonals) where waves 2 and 4 overlap
scribd.com
. These typically occur as fifth waves or C-waves. Terminal impulses still follow most impulse rules (5-wave count, wave-3 not shortest, etc.) but often show sluggish attributes: weaker volume that declines with each wave, exaggerated wave overlaps, and a dramatic breakdown after completion. Neely’s rules for terminals include: Wave 3 in a terminal often lacks a full 1.618× extension (since the whole pattern is constrained), but if extension rules aren’t met, the structure must be terminal and wave 5 often fails. Reverse Alternation can appear here: e.g., wave 2 a simple zigzag, wave 4 a more complex pattern contrary to typical alternation, hence “reverse.” This reflects a last-gasp, internally strained structure. Volume tends to diminish from waves 1 through 5 in a contracting terminal, confirming the loss of momentum. After a terminal impulse, expect an exceptionally sharp reversal retracing the entire pattern faster than it formed – a hallmark that the prior move was a terminal wave.

3. Corrective Patterns and Their Conditions

Corrective waves counteract the impulse and are typically composed of three sub-waves (A, B, C) or a combination of such triplets. All formations failing impulse rules are classified as Corrections
scribd.com
scribd.com
. NEoWave meticulously defines every correction type with numeric rules on wave relationships (price and time) to remove ambiguity:

Zigzag (5-3-5 structure)

A Zigzag is a sharp, simpler correction subdividing into a 5-wave decline (A), a 3-wave upward counter-trend (B), and another 5-wave move (C). It’s denoted 5-3-5 and often steep, like a typical “ABC” correction. Key Identification Rules:
(A) wave A must itself be an impulse or a leading diagonal (5-wave form), since zigzag’s first leg is motive. Wave A should not retrace more than 61.8% of the preceding impulse (one degree higher) if one exists
scribd.com
scribd.com
. A too-deep initial drop would imply a trend reversal rather than a correction.
(B) wave B is a partial retracement of A. The minimum retracement is 1% of A (to ensure B is non-zero and identifiable)
scribd.com
. The maximum retracement for B in a zigzag is 61.8% of A
scribd.com
 – any part of B exceeding 61.8% of A’s length disqualifies the pattern as a zigzag
scribd.com
. If B overshoots 61.8%, NEoWave logic says that rally is likely part of a more complex correction (B itself subdividing or morphing into a flat). Thus, no portion of B can go beyond 61.8% of A
scribd.com
; if it does, the end of B must be later, presumably at a lower retracement that meets the limit
scribd.com
. This essentially caps zigzag B-waves to being shallow or “weak” relative to A.
(C) wave C must travel beyond the end of A (to make net progress)
scribd.com
. Even if only slightly, wave C’s termination has to exceed A’s terminus
scribd.com
. This ensures a new extreme in the correction. The length of C relative to A determines the zigzag subtype:

If C is < 61.8% of A (very short), it’s a Truncated Zigzag
scribd.com
. NEoWave rule: C cannot be less than 38.2% of A even in a truncation
scribd.com
 – otherwise it’s too small to be wave C. Thus 38.2% ≤ C < 61.8% of A defines a truncated zigzag
scribd.com
. This rare variant implies a very weak ending. Confirmation comes if the market, after the zigzag, rapidly retraces 81% or more of the entire zigzag (ideally 100%+)
scribd.com
, showing the counter-trend was extraordinarily weak
scribd.com
. Truncated zigzags often occur as parts of larger patterns (e.g., within triangles) rather than standalone corrections
scribd.com
.

If C is between 61.8% and 161.8% of A (inclusive), it’s a Normal Zigzag
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Most zigzags fall here. A common case is C ≈ A in length or C ≈ 1.272×A, etc. The requirements are simply: B did not exceed 61.8% of A, and C ≥ 61.8% of A
scribd.com
.

If C is > 161.8% of A, it’s an Elongated Zigzag
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Here wave C is very large, often mimicking an impulse. Because an elongated zigzag’s C-wave can be dramatically long, NEoWave issues a caveat: when the third leg of a supposed correction exceeds 161.8% of the first leg, it may actually be the start of a new impulse
scribd.com
scribd.com
. The differentiation comes from what follows: after an elongated zigzag completes, the market should reverse and retrace at least 61.8% of wave C before C’s endpoint is breached again
scribd.com
. If it fails to do so (i.e., if price keeps going in C’s direction), then what was labeled A-B-C might have been waves 1-2-3 of an impulse
scribd.com
scribd.com
. In other words, elongated zigzags are the “impulse impersonators”, and only a strong reversal post-pattern confirms them as zigzags. Neely further restricts elongated zigzags to specific contexts: they appear early in contracting triangles (wave A of a triangle often) or as the final leg of an expanding triangle
scribd.com
. They are not expected as random corrections in any place.
Trend Continuation & Confirmation: Zigzags, being sharp, often occur in wave 2 positions or within larger corrections. To confirm a zigzag, NEoWave again uses time relationships: After an A-B-C zigzag finishes, a quick rebound should break the “0-B” trendline (drawn from start of A through end of B) in <= time C took
scribd.com
scribd.com
, and ultimately retrace wave C entirely in <= time C took
scribd.com
scribd.com
. These two stages of logic confirmation (trendline break and full retracement of C) validate that the zigzag correction is complete
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If B was shorter than A, stage 1 is the trendline break then stage 2 the full retrace; if B was longer than A, the order of confirmations reverses
scribd.com
. This time-based logic ensures the correction is truly over before one labels it finalized.
Invalidation: If the above numerical limits are not met (e.g., B > 61.8% of A, or C fails to go beyond A, etc.), the pattern is not a zigzag. Additionally, if any sub-wave of A or C internally violates impulse rules (since A and C must be impulsive 5’s), that would nullify a zigzag interpretation at that degree.

Flat (3-3-5 structure)

A Flat correction divides into three roughly equal-length waves: wave A and wave B are both corrective (each typically 3 waves), and wave C is motive (5 waves). The labeling is A, B, C with a pattern often denoted 3-3-5. Flats usually track sideways more than zigzags. NEoWave defines flats by the behavior of wave B relative to A, and wave C relative to A and B:
General Requirements: Wave B must retrace at least 61.8% of wave A
scribd.com
scribd.com
. This is the minimum – B can be equal to or even exceed A. Wave C must reach at least 38.2% of wave A in length
scribd.com
scribd.com
. These ensure that waves B and C are not too small. If B < 61.8% of A, the formation isn’t a flat (it might be a zigzag, where shallow B is acceptable). If C < 38.2% of A, then C is too stunted to qualify (likely an incomplete pattern).
Variation by B-wave size: Neely classifies flats by how far B goes relative to A
scribd.com
scribd.com
:

Strong B-wave Flat: B > 100% of A (i.e., B goes beyond A’s start, also known as an Expanded or Irregular Flat in Elliott terms). NEoWave calls it “strong” because B fully retraces A and then some. For strong B flats, wave C’s behavior depends on B’s overshoot:

If B is between 101% and 123.6% of A, then C likely exceeds B’s start (goes beyond the origin of A)
scribd.com
. If C ends between A’s start and B’s end, the pattern is an irregular (expanded) flat (C > A, but not by huge amount)
scribd.com
. If B > 123.6% of A, there’s only a remote chance C will exceed B’s start
scribd.com
, but it could still be irregular. And if B > 138.2% of A, there is virtually no chance for C to go past B’s start
scribd.com
 – the flat will almost certainly be a running flat (C fails to reach A’s start) in that case. In summary, very large B-waves ( > 138.2% ) signal that wave C will most likely fall short, making a running flat
scribd.com
.

Regardless, in any strong-B scenario, we draw horizontal lines at A’s start (0% of A) and end to see where C terminates
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If wave C stays between those lines (does not exceed A’s start), it’s an irregular failure flat (aka running flat). If C breaks above A’s start line, it’s an expanded flat (irregular flat)
scribd.com
. NEoWave explicitly notes: “As long as C is between the horizontal lines through A’s extremes, it’s likely an irregular failure flat. If C breaks through the start of A, a running correction occurs”
scribd.com
 (though here “running correction” seems to refer to C exceeding A’s start? Possibly a wording nuance: typically running flat means C fails to reach A’s start, but the text suggests the opposite – likely a translation issue. The context implies: a running correction is where C < A’s start, whereas exceeding it is an expanded flat).

Normal B-wave Flat: B is 81%–100% of A
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Wave B doesn’t quite hit A’s start but almost. In this common case, wave C is expected to go beyond B’s start (because B didn’t overextend)
scribd.com
. The specific classifications:

If C < 100% of B, it’s a C-failure flat (C does not reach B’s start)
scribd.com
. This is analogous to an Elliott “running flat” situation but here B was normal, so one could call it a mild running flat.

If C is 100% to 138.2% of B, it’s a Regular Flat
scribd.com
 – wave C reaches or slightly exceeds the start of A (covering B fully and then some, but not dramatically). Often C ≈ A in length in these.

If C > 138.2% of B, it’s an Elongated Flat
scribd.com
 – the C-wave is very long relative to B. This can happen; it means the final sell-off/buy-off overshoots. Typically elongated flats still respect that C is not ridiculously large compared to A (usually C ≤ 2×A or so, otherwise the structure might be reinterpreted).

Weak B-wave Flat: B is 61.8%–80% of A (inclusive minimum)
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Here B is relatively shallow. Then:

If C < 100% of B, it’s a Double Failure Flat
scribd.com
. “Double failure” meaning B didn’t reach A’s start (failure #1) and C didn’t reach B’s start (failure #2). This is quite a flat that hardly went anywhere – price compressing.

If C is 100%–138.2% of B, it’s a B-failure Flat
scribd.com
. (Called “B-failure” presumably because B was weak; essentially C does reach B’s start, but B itself failed to reach A’s start.)

If C > 138.2% of B, it’s an Elongated Flat again (specifically elongated despite a weak B, so wave C really dominates)
scribd.com
.
In all flat variations, note that wave B ≥ 61.8% of A and wave C ≥ 38.2% of A are always true
scribd.com
scribd.com
 (these were the base requirements). The above sub-categories just refine how far B and C go.
Confirmation (Logic) for Flats: NEoWave states that confirming a correction’s completion involves two stages, which can occur in either order depending on B’s size
scribd.com
scribd.com
. For flats (and zigzags) the same logic applies:

Stage 1: A post-correction move should break the 0–B trendline (drawn from the start of A through end of B) in <= the time C took
scribd.com
. This indicates a decisive reversal. If it takes longer, either the correction isn’t done or it’s morphing (e.g., C becoming a terminal)
scribd.com
.

Stage 2: The entire wave C should be retraced (price returns to A’s start or beyond) in <= the time it took for C to form
scribd.com
. This confirms the correction pattern fully unwound.
If B < A (shorter B), the expectation is to see Stage 1 then 2; if B > A (overshooting B), the confirmations reverse (first full retracement of C, then trendline break)
scribd.com
. When both stages are met, confidence in the identified flat pattern is extremely high
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If only one stage confirms, the count might be right but alternatives should be kept in mind
scribd.com
. Notably, in complex corrections (with double or triple structures), only the final “simple” correction needs confirmation – one need not confirm each component individually
scribd.com
. So an X-wave followed by a flat, for instance, is confirmed by confirming the flat’s completion.
Invalidation: If wave B is less than 61.8% of A, the pattern is not a flat (likely a zigzag). If wave C < 38.2% of A, not a flat (pattern likely incomplete). If wave C fails to materialize as a 5-wave structure, then what was thought to be a flat might be something else (like part of a triangle). Also, if subsequent market action breaks the rules (e.g., instead of reversing after C, price continues trending, violating confirmation), then the flat interpretation could be wrong. NEoWave’s strict logic steps often catch miscounts early: e.g., if after a presumed flat, the 0–B line isn’t broken in time, it hints wave C might be extending or pattern is turning complex.

Triangles (3-3-3-3-3 structure)

Triangles are lateral, consolidative corrections with five sub-waves labeled A-B-C-D-E, each segment being a corrective (3-wave or combination) move. NEoWave expands the triangle family, introducing new forms (like Neutral Triangles) and precise requirements. General Triangle Rules (all types):

A triangle always subdivides into 5 segments (waves A through E)
scribd.com
.

Each segment is corrective, i.e., a “three” or combination labeled as such
scribd.com
. Thus the internal wave structure is 3-3-3-3-3.

The five waves oscillate in the same price range with a narrowing or widening scope
scribd.com
. There is substantial overlap: each wave after A moves within the bounds of the preceding waves. The entire triangle unfolds essentially as a sideways coil (possibly drifting slightly).

The triangle may drift modestly upward or downward as it forms, but this drift doesn’t violate the overlap principle
scribd.com
scribd.com
 (the drift is typically within the envelope of prior swings).

Wave B’s length must be between 38.2% and 261.8% of wave A
scribd.com
scribd.com
. This is a critical NEoWave addition. It means B can be shorter than A (down to 38.2%) or much longer (up to 2.618× A), but not beyond. This encompasses both contracting-style (B smaller) and expanding-style (B larger) triangles. If B < 38.2% of A, it’s too small for a triangle leg (the structure might be a different pattern). If B > 261.8% of A, then wave B is disproportionate, violating triangle logic.

Three of the four corrective waves (B, C, D, E) must retrace at least 50% of the previous segment
scribd.com
. That is, out of waves b, c, d, e (lowercase indicating any internal sub-wave), at least three satisfy: length of waveX ≥ 0.5 * length of wave (X-1). This ensures a decent back-and-forth tug; a running triangle where corrections are all small wouldn’t meet this fully (Neely allows an exception: in a running triangle, one of those three might fail the 50% threshold)
scribd.com
.

Only 4 of the 5 wave endpoints should lie on the two boundary lines of the triangle
scribd.com
. In other words, when you connect trendlines around a triangle, typically one trendline touches three turning points and the opposite line touches two – total of 5 touches. NEoWave expects that one of the five waves will not neatly hit the trendline intersection (“apex”). If all 5 points lie perfectly on two lines, it’s an idealized case but often a clue the pattern might be a different formation (Non-limiting triangles can sometimes show an extra fifth touch or unusual apex behavior
scribd.com
scribd.com
).

The baseline (b-d line): connecting wave B’s end and wave D’s end yields the critical trendline. NEoWave says no part of wave C or E should break back through the B-D baseline
scribd.com
scribd.com
. This is analogous to the Elliott rule that the line from B to D in a triangle is rarely pierced internally. If wave C or E significantly crosses the B-D line, the structure might not be a true triangle (or it’s an indication of a very skewed formation).

Post-Triangle Thrust: After a triangle completes (end of wave E), there is usually a sharp thrust in the direction of the prior larger trend (i.e., if the triangle was corrective, the thrust continues the impulse that preceded the triangle). For a Contracting Triangle, NEoWave quantifies this thrust: it should be at least 75% of the length of the widest triangle segment, and usually not more than 125% of that widest segment
scribd.com
scribd.com
. (The widest segment is often wave A, but could be B or C in shape
scribd.com
.) Additionally, the thrust must exceed the furthest price extreme of the triangle (if triangle was contracting, thrust goes beyond A or beyond C, whichever was more extreme)
scribd.com
scribd.com
. If a “triangle” fails to produce a thrust beyond the triangle’s price range, it likely wasn’t a proper triangle.

Wave E can’t be the fastest by far: Specifically, the last wave (E) should not be the shortest in time among the five
scribd.com
. If wave E is ridiculously quick compared to A–D, it might mean the pattern ended early or transformed. All five waves should consume substantial time, with E not trivial in duration.

Using these general rules, one must first identify a potential 5-wave sideways structure and check these criteria. Once general triangle conditions 1–10 are satisfied, we classify the triangle as contracting, expanding, or one of Neely’s additional types (limiting, non-limiting, running, etc.) based on side lengths and slope:

Contracting Triangles

This is the most common triangle type (prices converge). Definition: Each wave is smaller than the previous in amplitude – A is largest, then B, C, D, and E each progressively smaller. Necessary conditions in NEoWave
scribd.com
scribd.com
:

After the triangle, the thrust = 75% to 125% of the triangle’s widest leg
scribd.com
scribd.com
 (as noted above). This thrust should break out of the triangle’s price bounds
scribd.com
.

The thrust must go beyond the highest high/lowest low of the triangle range (depending on thrust direction)
scribd.com
scribd.com
, except possibly when the entire triangle “drifts” opposite to thrust (a rare caveat where one boundary is angled against the eventual breakout)
scribd.com
.

Wave E cannot be the shortest in time (general rule #9) – reiterated as an essential check

. Typically E is actually one of the smaller waves in price, but not inconsequential in time.

By the end of wave E, often the triangle’s pattern will satisfy: wave E’s endpoint should fall noticeably before the apex (intersection) of the triangle’s trendlines. In Limiting Triangles (a subset of contracting), wave E ends 20%–40% of the horizontal distance prior to the apex
scribd.com
. That is, measure the total duration from triangle start (wave A) to where lines converge; E should end about 20–40% before that full time. This means the triangle does not fully close up — a limiting triangle completes with some space before the lines meet, typically producing a clean thrust. If E ended much sooner (>>40% before apex) or much later (at apex or beyond), it’s Non-Limiting (discussed shortly)

.

Types of Contracting Triangles: Neely breaks them into:

Horizontal (Symmetrical) Triangle: The most standard contracting triangle. Trendlines move in opposite directions (one down, one up). Requirements: D is smaller than C, E is smaller than D
scribd.com
, apex around 61.8% of time (presumably meaning E ends ~37%-40% before apex – phrasing suggests “apex must fall within 61.8% of longest segment’s time”? Actually text: “apex point of triangle must fall within a range of 61.8% of the longest segment”
scribd.com
). Essentially, the triangle is nicely proportioned.

Irregular Triangle (contracting): Similar to horizontal but with one exceptional wave. Rules: Wave B ≤ 261.8% of A (usually <161.8% in practice)
scribd.com
. Waves C, D, E each smaller than the previous wave (so contraction holds)
scribd.com
. Trendlines still opposite in slope. The distinction of “irregular” here likely implies B might be a bit larger or D might overshoot a bit, but still contracting overall.

Running Triangle (contracting): A rarer contracting form where the triangle itself slants in the trend direction (looks like a pennant). Rules: Wave B is longer than A and is the longest wave of the five
scribd.com
 (that’s unusual for contracting, but possible if A was small). Wave C < B, wave D > C, wave E < D (so after B, the contraction resumes)
scribd.com
. Both trendlines slope in the same direction (up or down)
scribd.com
, giving the “running” appearance. Also, the thrust after a running triangle is much larger than normal, often up to 261.8% of the widest segment
scribd.com
. But not beyond 261.8% – Neely caps it
scribd.com
. Essentially running triangles store a lot of energy and break out strongly. They can be deceptive because the whole formation drifts with the trend.

All contracting triangles obey the baseline rule (b-d line) and general rules described. Limiting vs Non-limiting in contracting: Limiting triangles are the typical case where E finishes well before the apex (20–40%). If a contracting triangle instead continues almost to the apex or beyond the normal time, it’s Non-Limiting.

Non-Limiting Contracting Triangles: They meet all price pattern rules but their time aspect is stretched or odd. Neely gives diagnostics: 
scribd.com
scribd.com

a. “Late congestion”: If price congests until very near the apex (the converging trendlines come together with <20% of pattern time left after E ends)
scribd.com
, it’s non-limiting (the triangle effectively used almost all available space).
b. “Early apex”: If the trendline intersection (apex) occurs too early, i.e., before 40% of the triangle’s duration has passed after E, that also indicates non-limiting
scribd.com
. This could mean the pattern ended well past where apex would have been, or the lines converged long before the pattern ended (perhaps due to a slight overthrow).
c. Post-thrust retrace: If after thrust, the correction (usually an X-wave) pushes back into the triangle’s apex zone (time-wise), that’s a sign the triangle was non-limiting
scribd.com
. Usually in limiting triangles, the correction after thrust doesn’t reach the apex time period. In non-limiting, perhaps the thrust happened so late that the correction goes into that time zone.
Non-limiting triangles often occur as part of larger complex corrections (hence “non-standard position”). They don’t change the wave count, but they warn that the triangle was either an X-wave or preceding final wave, which might affect post-thrust expectations (e.g., thrust could be an X wave itself if triangle was part of complex). In practice, non-limiting vs limiting is a subtlety; algorithmically one can flag a triangle whose E-wave ends too close to or beyond the apex as “non-limiting” and treat its implications slightly differently (like expecting a different post-pattern behavior as Neely suggests).

Expanding Triangles

These are triangles that diverge, with each wave larger than the previous (wave E largest). They are less common and often appear in high-degree complex corrections. General rules for expanding (nearly mirror contracting but in reverse)
scribd.com
scribd.com
:

Either wave A or B will be the smallest segment (since it grows)
scribd.com
. Typically A is smallest, but it could start slow and B be smallest in some cases; in any event one of the first two is the tiny one.

Wave E is almost always the largest wave
scribd.com
scribd.com
 – characteristic of expanding shape.

Expanding triangles cannot occur in certain positions: you won’t find an expanding triangle as a wave B of a zigzag, nor as wave B, C, or D of a larger triangle
scribd.com
. This confines expanding triangles usually to wave A positions of large corrections, or perhaps wave 4 of huge impulses (rare), or in very complex formations as standalone patterns followed by big moves.

Wave E is usually the most time-consuming and complex wave
scribd.com
, often a compound correction (zigzag or double zigzag, etc.) since it’s largest.

Wave E will typically break beyond the trendline drawn through A and C’s endpoints
scribd.com
. That upper boundary is exceeded by E (unlike contracting where E stays inside lines). This is expected as lines diverge.

The B-D line still should not be violated by C or E intrusions
scribd.com
 (baseline logic still holds similarly).

The thrust after an expanding triangle tends to be smaller relative to the triangle size: NEoWave says the thrust should be less than wave E (the widest wave), unless the expanding triangle is ending a larger correction
scribd.com
. So after an expanding triangle, the breakout is often a short pop (<100% of wave E) before reversing if it’s part of a combo, or, if it was the final correction, the next impulse is just beginning so thrust could eventually extend beyond initial expectations.

Similar to contracting, at least 3 of the 4 corrective waves (B, C, D, E) should retrace ≥50% of the prior wave
scribd.com
 (the text mentions “three waves preceding E must be ≥50% of the next wave” – effectively same idea: A vs B, B vs C, C vs D maybe).
Expanding triangles also have Limiting vs Non-Limiting subcategories, though NEoWave implies the distinction is less crucial. Limiting Expanding Triangles: extremely rare, possibly wave 4 in an impulse or wave B in some corrections
scribd.com
. If one occurs as a B-wave (of a larger flat, say), Neely notes:

B-wave expanding triangles likely only happen in Irregular failure flats or C-failure flats
scribd.com
 (i.e., a flat where B overshot A a lot, making triangle as B).

The thrust of a limiting expanding triangle is relatively small: only ~61.8% retracement of the triangle’s price range
scribd.com
. That is, the breakout isn’t huge because it’s likely a part of a containing pattern.

The three types of expanding (limiting) triangles are analogous to contracting ones: Horizontal (expanding), Irregular (expanding), Running (expanding). For example:

Horizontal expanding: extremely uncommon, all waves bigger than the last, one boundary roughly horizontal (nearly flat)
scribd.com
scribd.com
 – e.g., wave A small, then B, C, D, E all successively larger, maybe one side hardly moving so price expands mostly one direction.

Criteria: Wave A must be smallest
scribd.com
; each of waves B, C, D, E goes beyond the prior wave’s end
scribd.com
 (so consistently making new extremes each leg); wave E often breaks beyond the trendline from A to C
scribd.com
 (like general expanding rule).

Irregular expanding: more common than horizontal expanding. Characterized by one out-of-place smaller wave among otherwise expanding series
scribd.com
.

Either wave B is smaller than A while C, D, E get larger than prior (so initial wave was large, B dips smaller, then expansion resumes from C onward), or wave D is smaller than C while E still larger than D (so one contraction in the middle)
scribd.com
.

It basically means not every wave is larger than the last, but overall the triangle expands. It can have an off-size blip.

Additionally, longer time periods favor skewed channeling (the longer the pattern, the more likely its trendlines aren’t symmetric horizontal vs vertical, but slanted)
scribd.com
.

Running expanding: looks like a trending move because both boundaries slope the same way, though diverging
scribd.com
.

Defined by: Wave B slightly larger than A, and wave D slightly shorter than C
scribd.com
, with all other waves larger than previous. The net effect is both trendlines (A-C and B-D) slope upward or downward together, but still diverging.

E-wave can be quite violent here, as the pattern ends explosively. Another variant mentioned: sometimes all waves are larger than previous except wave C, which is shorter than B
scribd.com
 (so maybe A small, B bigger, C slightly smaller than B, then D, E huge – a different quirk).
Non-Limiting Expanding Triangles: these occur in complex scenarios, e.g., triangle as part of a combination. They obey the same price rules but have an “apex” relationship in time. Neely gives a guideline: measure total time from triangle start to end of E. Then take 40% of that duration and count backward from the start (i.e., 60% mark of pattern start) – the apex point will occur before 40% of time
scribd.com
. In other words, the trendlines would intersect in the past, long before the pattern ended. Usually apex happens around 20% of the pattern time in these cases
scribd.com
. This effectively describes the visual: the lines diverge so steeply that if you extend them backward they cross way earlier than the pattern’s end, highlighting it’s non-limiting. Post-triangle implications: If expanding triangle is non-limiting, often it serves as an X-wave or part of a larger correction, and the thrust may itself be that connecting wave. But identification wise, the algorithm just notes the time relationships to categorize it.
NEoWave example confirmation for expanding: The example at the end verifies:

Wave B smallest, wave E biggest (check)

E breaks A-C line (check)

So pattern confirmed expanding triangle.

Neutral Triangle: NEoWave introduces “Neutral Triangles” as a special case (often considered a subset of expanding or contracting patterns depending on perspective, but essentially one boundary contracts and the other expands). Although not explicitly named in the excerpt above, a Neutral Triangle occurs when one side is contracting and the opposite side is expanding
neowave.com
neowave.com
. For example, in a Neutral Contracting triangle, wave B is significantly smaller than wave D (reverse alternation: wave D > B), but wave A and wave C still set contracting highs; in a Neutral Expanding triangle, perhaps wave B > D (wave D < B, reverse), but lows expand. In simpler terms, a neutral triangle is like a cross between contracting and expanding – one of the two defining trendlines is roughly horizontal (flat), while the other slopes, causing an asymmetrical shape. Typically:

In a neutral (ascending) triangle, the upper boundary is flat (waves A and C peaks about equal), and the lows (waves B, D, and E) ascend (higher lows). Wave D overshoots wave B in complexity or length (reverse alternation present: D > B)
neowave.com
. The post-triangle thrust often goes in the direction of the slope (upward here), and interestingly can be moderate because the flat top acted as resistance.

In a neutral (descending) triangle, the lower boundary is flat (equal lows for A and C perhaps), and the highs descend (lower highs each wave). Wave D is larger than B as well (if reverse alternation occurs).
The rule of reverse alternation is often cited with neutral triangles: one pair of opposite waves (B vs D) violates normal alternation by the later wave being more complex/time-consuming
neowave.com
. Neely’s guidelines: If waves B & D exhibit reverse alternation (B smaller, D larger in price/time), then the classification changes: a contracting triangle with reverse alternation may be termed Neutral because one side fails to contract properly
neowave.com
neowave.com
. Similarly, an expanding triangle where B & D don’t progressively expand might be neutral. Implications: The breakout channels differently – if reverse alternation in B & D, the standard contracting/expanding channel projections adjust (Neely notes differences in drawing channels for those)
neowave.com
neowave.com
. For algorithmic rules, neutral triangles would meet general triangle rules but not neatly fit purely contracting or expanding definitions. A telltale sign: wave B and D of very unequal size, where D > B in contracting scenario (or B > D in expanding scenario). Post-triangle thrust in neutrals can be tricky; generally it will exceed the extreme of wave C or A as required, but might be shorter or more muted than typical expanding/contracting cases due to one flat side.

Triangle Invalidations: If any of the 5 general rules are broken, the pattern is not a valid triangle:

Only 3 or fewer segments instead of 5, or one segment is an impulse (5) instead of a 3.

Wave B out of 38.2–261.8% range of A
scribd.com
.

Fewer than 3 of B,C,D,E retrace 50% of prior.

The B-D line being broken by wave C or E internally.

For contracting: thrust not exceeding triangle range, or thrust far overshooting 125% without special context.

For expanding: failing to expand (e.g., wave E not largest), or thrust exceeding triangle’s largest leg by too much (except if at end of a huge correction).
In practice, NEoWave’s numerous conditions make triangle recognition robust and exclusive. An algorithm would enforce each numeric limit (e.g., check wave lengths for percent criteria, time proportions for apex, etc.) to confirm a triangle pattern.

Complex Corrections (Combinations)

When a single 3-wave correction (zigzag, flat, or triangle) is not sufficient to correct the prior impulse, the market can form complex corrections by linking multiple corrective patterns with connecting “X” waves. NEoWave formalizes complexity with strict limits, introducing the Rule of Complexity (complexity cap) to avoid endless chaining. Key points:

Double Three and Triple Three: These are the most common complex corrections, consisting of two or three simple corrections connected by one or two X-waves respectively. For example, a Double Three might be Flat – X – Zigzag or Zigzag – X – Triangle, etc. Each component is a valid pattern on its own, and X is a intervening wave (usually a small zigzag or flat) that bridges them. Complexity Cap: Glenn Neely’s rules state that the maximum number of corrections in combination is three (a triple three)
neowave.com
neowavechart.com
. In other words, no more than 2 X-waves are allowed at the same degree – a fourth correction would violate complexity limits. So algorithmically, if you find more than 3 distinct corrective phases, it likely implies you are mislabeling or dealing with a higher degree pattern. This cap prevents runaway interpretations.

X-Wave Rules: The connecting wave X is typically a corrective wave (often a zigzag or flat) that moves generally in the same direction as the larger trend (i.e., it provides a partial retracement of the previous correction, “bouncing” before the next correction). NEoWave imposes strict price, time, and complexity limits on X-waves
neowave.com
neowave.com
 to ensure they remain “connecting” and not new trends:

Complexity: An X-wave’s complexity (number of subdivisions) should be no less complex than the simplest prior correction leg and no more complex than the entire previous correction pattern
neowave.com
neowave.com
. For example, if the preceding correction was a flat (which has complexity of 2, since flat’s internal A and B can be broken further? or treat each simple pattern’s complexity as 1?), essentially X can’t be ridiculously simple if the prior was complex, and can’t out-complicate what it’s connecting.

Time: X must take at least as much time as the shortest leg of the prior correction, and at most the total time of the prior correction
neowave.com
. Often, Neely suggests X will be 1/3 to 1 times the duration of the previous correction
neowave.com
. It should not consume more time than the entire pattern it corrects
neowave.com
 (this is a hard rule: “An X-wave CANNOT consume more time than the correction before it or the correction after it”
neowave.com
).

Price: Similarly, X’s price amplitude should be at least as large as the smallest segment of the prior correction, and not larger than the entire prior correction’s range
neowave.com
. Typically, Neely notes X often retraces ~33% to 100% of the previous correction’s price range
neowave.com
. Specifically after a flat, X can even be up to 161.8% of the prior flat’s price range
neowave.com
 (flats often under-correct price, so X might compensate a bit more).

Invalidation: If an X-wave breaks these limits (too long, too large, too complex), it’s not acting as an X-wave but perhaps the start of a new trend or a higher-degree wave. For instance, if what you think is “X” takes longer than the ABC it connects, then likely ABC was only part of a larger correction or the structure is something else (like a triangle unfolding).

Double Three Identification: We label something W-X-Y (where W and Y are each zigzag/flat/triangle). The algorithm should first try to see if one contiguous corrective move breaks into two distinguishable corrections separated by a brief counter-trend pop (the X). Example: after an A-B-C zigzag, instead of a new impulse resuming, the market makes a partial rebound (X wave) that fails to make a new high beyond the start of A, then another A-B-C forms. That sequence likely is a double correction. The invalidations for double three are mostly covered by pattern limits: If the second correction Y doesn’t fit with the first, or if “X” is too big, the count is wrong. Also, NEoWave’s Rule of Alternation in Complexes: If the first correction was simple (say a zigzag), the second tends to be a different type (flat or triangle) – much like wave2 vs wave4 alternation but now applied to successive corrections. If both corrections appear identical (e.g., zigzag followed by zigzag of similar degree), consider if it might actually be one larger zigzag or a more complex pattern like a triangle in disguise. Neely’s Complexity Limits ensure you not erroneously label something as a double if a single pattern could explain it with acceptable flexibility.

Triple Three: W-X-Y-X-Z. Extremely rare but possible when market corrects for a very long time. Each of W, Y, Z must be simpler corrections (zigzags, flats, or triangles). Triangles often appear as the final component Z to finish a complex correction (since triangles conclude corrections). Complexity cap: triple three is max – you won’t see “quadruple three.” The second X-wave (before Z) must also obey X rules relative to Y, etc. Typically, if an algorithm finds two X-waves, it should strongly check that Z is indeed a final simple pattern because any further extension likely violates NEoWave’s allowable complexity.

Running Combinations: Sometimes the entire double/triple three might not move net sideways but drift with the larger trend (similar to a running flat idea extended). NEoWave’s time rules for confirmation still apply: the ultimate end of the complex correction can be confirmed by the same two-stage logic (break of the last X-B trendline and retracement of last C). Only the last simple correction’s completion needs confirmation
scribd.com
. For example, in a double three, confirm Y’s end with logic; that inherently confirms the whole pattern W-X-Y.

Examples of formal logic: If you suspect a double three and identify W and Y, you’d draw a trendline from the start of W to end of X, etc., but formal confirmation is usually done when entire combo is over. The complexity and time limits are preventative: they should be coded as checks to disallow improbable counts:

e.g., If Y takes twice as long as W, maybe W was an X of higher degree or labeling wrong.

Or if X-wave is larger than W, possibly W was not a completed correction yet.

Thermodynamic Balance & Proportionality: Neely often speaks of the market’s corrections in quasi-thermodynamic terms – the idea that the “effort” (time and complexity) spent in one part of a correction should be balanced by the next part. This essentially underpins rules like the complexity and time limits for X-waves, and the guideline that in combinations, typically the simpler correction will be followed by a more complex one, but not too much more complex. The Rule of Elasticity can be interpreted here: if one correction is unusually brief or shallow, the next tends to “stretch out” more to compensate (like an elastic band snapping back). Conversely, if one part is already long/detailed, the next can be shorter. This prevents a lopsided series. Thermodynamic balance in practice means the market seeks equilibrium: huge distortions in one wave tend to be countered by opposing forces in subsequent waves. For an algorithm, this is encoded in ratio limits (e.g., X typically 0.33x to 1.0x the prior correction in time/price
neowave.com
). These concepts ensure the overall correction has a degree of symmetry and that no single component is out of whack with the rest.

4. NEoWave Unique Rules and Enhancements

Beyond pattern definitions, NEoWave introduces additional quantitative rules that govern wave relationships and help in falsifying incorrect counts. These act as the “strong rules” to objectively verify a wave count:

Rule of Proportionality (Price & Time): This rule asserts that waves of the same degree should be proportional in both price and time. It’s essentially enforced by the Similarity & Balance rule
neowave.com
. Numerically, for any two adjacent waves of the same degree, the smaller must be ≥ 33% of the larger in price range and in duration
neowave.com
. If a wave is both far shorter in price and far faster in time than the previous wave, it’s likely of a lower degree (or part of the prior wave). The algorithm should check this for every pair of candidate waves labeled at the same degree: if any pair violates 1/3 proportion in both aspects, the segmentation must be revised
neowave.com
. This rule prevents, for example, labeling a tiny blip as wave-2 and a huge swing as wave-1 of the same degree – it wouldn’t satisfy similarity. In modeling, this ensures consistency in scale.

Rule of Alternation (and Reverse Alternation): Alternation in form between subsequent corrective waves is expected
scribd.com
. NEoWave uses it in impulses (wave 2 vs 4) and in some patterns (like legs of a triangle). The twist Neely adds is Reverse Alternation, observed especially in triangles
neowave.com
neowave.com
. Reverse alternation means the later alternate wave is more complex than the earlier, the opposite of normal expectation. For instance, in a contracting triangle, normally wave B is more complex, wave D simpler – but if instead B is simple and D is more complex and time-consuming, that’s reverse alternation. Neely found that reverse alternation correlates with Neutral Triangles and some complex scenario triangles. The presence of reverse alternation can help identify a triangle’s type and how to draw its trendlines (affecting which side is limiting). For an algorithm, once it identifies a triangle, it should check B vs D in both price and time. If D is significantly larger or longer than B, flag the triangle as a Reverse Alternation Triangle, and adjust expectations: e.g., the thrust might align more with wave-D’s direction and one side of the triangle might be near-parallel
neowave.com
neowave.com
. In impulse context, reverse alternation is less common, but Neely’s “Reverse Alternation rule” primarily refers to triangle classification.

Rule of Elasticity: This concept refers to how far a wave can stretch or compress relative to prior waves. While not explicitly labeled in the text, it’s reflected in rules like B-wave range in flats and triangles and X-wave limits. Essentially, the market has elastic limits – e.g., B in a flat can stretch to 138% or even 261% of A in extreme cases, but beyond that the “elastic” snaps (pattern breaks down). The algorithm includes these elasticity limits: any wave trying to exceed the max percentages triggers invalidation. For instance, wave B elasticity in triangles: B can stretch to 261.8% of A max
scribd.com
; in flats: B can stretch to ~138% or more, but beyond a point (like 200%+) it’s dubious as a flat. These are built into the pattern rules above. Elasticity also implies recovery: after an elongated wave, expect a strong reversal (like after elongated zigzag C, expect >61.8% rebound
scribd.com
scribd.com
). So it’s both predictive and limiting.

Time-Price Equality (Balance): NEoWave pays attention that time and price “balances” often signal pattern completion. For example, a correction is often deemed complete when the time taken by the corrective phase is commensurate with the price change achieved. In practical rules: Thermodynamic Balance Rule could mean that a correction tends toward a state where the “energy” (time and price distance) is in equilibrium with the preceding impulse’s energy. One manifestation: Neely suggests that often wave 4 (time-consuming flat/triangle) balances out a quick wave 2, so that overall the correction in an impulse has a time/price balance. Also in complex corrections, if first part was short in time but deep in price, second might be long in time but shallow, balancing each other. Though not given a strict formula in our sources, an algorithm can incorporate this by expecting that no correction ends extremely unbalanced – e.g., if price correction is shallow but it’s taken an enormous amount of time, likely it’s not done (maybe a triangle forming). Conversely, a very deep price correction done super fast might imply only part of correction done. NEoWave’s confirmation logic partly handles this by requiring certain time relationships (post-correction moves in <= time of C, etc.)
scribd.com
scribd.com
. Essentially time and price conditions must both be satisfied for a pattern to finalize.

Complexity Cap (Max Complexity): As noted, NEoWave caps complexity: no pattern can extend beyond a triple three. Additionally, triangles are the only 5-wave corrections; there’s also mention of new NEoWave patterns like Diametrics and Symmetricals (beyond scope of classic patterns) in Neely’s work
neowave.com
, but presumably those also follow a complexity limit. An algorithm should not attempt to label a sequence with four or more distinct corrections in a row at the same degree – it should then relabel the entire thing as something else (perhaps a new pattern like a Diametric, which is a seven-legged corrective pattern not covered above, or treat it as a higher degree move). Complexity measurement is built into X-wave rules as well, preventing unlimited chain of small X-waves connecting many corrections
neowave.com
neowave.com
.

NEoWave Channeling Technique: Unlike simple parallel Elliott channels, Neely’s channeling draws lines after certain waves to project targets and confirm patterns. For impulses, one draws point-to-point channels (2-4 line as base, 1-3 line etc.) and expects wave 5 to fit within or throw over slightly
litefinance.org
litefinance.org
. For corrections, trendlines like 0-B lines or B-D lines in triangles are used not just to illustrate but to test completion: e.g., the break of 0-B in time
scribd.com
, or the maintenance of B-D line integrity
scribd.com
. NEoWave channeling rules are quantitative:

In impulses: The 2-4 line shouldn’t be breached by wave 5 until impulse done. If it is breached early by wave 5, one might suspect a terminal or an ending diagonal where rules differ slightly.

In triangles: The B-D line must not be broken internally
scribd.com
 – check as pattern forms. Also channel (trendlines) convergence timing (limiting vs non-limiting) is measured in percentage of pattern time
scribd.com
scribd.com
.

In complex corrections: after combining patterns, often a channel connecting the start of W and end of Y, etc., might help identify when Z is done (though specific rules not given above, one can extrapolate logic).
Channeling, in code, becomes a way to verify geometry: e.g., if an alleged triangle’s E goes beyond the trendline drawn from A-C too soon (should only break at end of E for expanding), that violates the triangle structure.

Thermodynamic “Heat” and Volume: NEoWave also uniquely advocates using volume to validate patterns, treating volume as analogous to market “energy.” For instance, in a contracting triangle, volume should dwindle as the pattern progresses (lower “thermodynamic activity” as system cools off), then volume surges on the thrust. In expanding triangles, volume might be more erratic but often increases toward wave E. For impulses: a normal impulse sees volume peak at wave 3 and often diverge in wave 5
litefinance.org
 (though our sources didn’t directly quote volume, this is a known guideline: Volume signature – rising in 1-3, peaking 3, dropping 4, minor rise or divergence in 5). For an algorithm, volume rules can serve as additional checks:

If an supposed wave 3 has low volume relative to wave 1, reconsider (maybe it’s part of correction).

If during a triangle formation volume isn’t dropping at all, maybe it’s not a triangle.

If a large correction sees volume expand instead of contract at the tail end, perhaps it’s not a correction but an impulsive development.
Volume is secondary (price structure rules dominate), but it can provide probabilistic filtering in the model.

In summary, NEoWave’s special rules give a robust logical framework: any proposed wave count must pass numerous numeric tests (retracement %, extension ratios, time ratios, complexity counts, etc.). These create a rule-based failsafe system – if a condition is violated, the software must invalidate that scenario. This is why Neely’s methodology is well-suited to algorithmic coding: it emphasizes falsification criteria at every step (e.g., “if at least one impulse rule is not fulfilled, label the formation corrective”
litefinance.org
). The totality of rules covers price, time, structure, and even volume, leaving little room for subjective judgment.

5. Pattern Identification Priority & Workflow

With the vast rule set above, a NEoWave analysis follows a priority sequence to identify the correct pattern amid many possibilities:

Impulsive vs Corrective Determination: First and foremost, the algorithm should decide if a given wave sequence is impulsive or corrective. NEoWave suggests starting with the assumption of an impulse (trend) and attempt to disprove it via the invalidation rules
litefinance.org
. If any impulse rule fails (e.g., overlap, wave-3 not extended, etc.), immediately classify the sequence as a Correction
litefinance.org
. This binary fork is step one. Impulses have stricter rules, so it’s usually easier to falsify an impulse than to enumerate all correction options upfront. In practice, the program will scan a sequence of swings: if it finds 5 discernible sub-waves and no rule broken, it's an impulse candidate; if something like “wave 2 > 100% of wave 1” or “no extension present” occurs, then impulse is off the table and the corrective path is taken.

Among Impulses – which type? If impulse is valid, determine if it’s Trending or Terminal. Check wave 4 overlap with wave 1: if yes, classify as a Terminal impulse (diagonal)
scribd.com
. Then apply the special terminal constraints (likely volume decline, smaller wave 5, etc.). If no overlap, it’s a normal trending impulse. Also check which wave extended: usually wave 3; if extension unclear, consider if wave 1 might have extended (rare) or wave 5 (in stock indexes wave 5 sometimes extends). There’s also a 3rd-wave extension vs 5th-wave extension nuance: e.g., in commodities, fifth can extend, which slightly alters expectations (like alternation tends to be different, volume trend differs). The program can decide extension by comparing lengths: identify the longest wave among 1,3,5 – that’s the extension. Then verify the ≥161.8% rule
scribd.com
 for that wave or apply exceptions if needed
scribd.com
. If none are ≥161.8%, impulse count is suspect (maybe it’s a “failed impulse” needing reconsideration or more likely a correction).

Among Corrections – identify type by first swing and retracement: If it’s corrective, look at wave A and B behavior:

If the first segment after the impulse is a 5-wave structure and the second segment (B) is shallow (< 61.8%), suspect a Zigzag. The algorithm would verify: A as 5-wave impulse, B < 61.8% of A

, C then expected. If B indeed stays below 61.8% retracement, the pattern must be zigzag (no other correction has such a shallow B except maybe a triangle leg, but triangle A is 3-wave). So zigzag gets priority whenever A is strong 5 and B is modest.

If the first segment A is a 3-wave structure and B retraces deeply (≥ 61.8%), suspect a Flat. Further check B’s endpoint: e.g., B near 100% or beyond A implies expanded flat possibilities

; B just over 61.8% suggests normal/weak flat

.

If the correction exhibits five segments oscillating in range, suspect a Triangle. Often by the time three segments are in place (A, B, C), one can guess triangle if each is a clear 3-wave and they’re stalling progress. The algorithm should be looking: if after an initial A-B-C, instead of terminating, price makes a D that stays within range, that’s a triangle signature (especially if volume and volatility contract). Triangles generally have unmistakable sideways shape by wave D.

Complex vs Simple: If a correction seems to have more than 3 waves of significance (e.g., A-B-C-D-E or more), the program should consider triangle (5-wave) or combination (W-X-Y structure). After identifying one part, say it found a zigzag that ended but the market makes another ABC without a new high past the zigzag’s start – that’s a clue of double three. NEoWave even has a procedure: after one correction is done and market fails to produce a motive wave in the new direction, then the correction likely isn’t over – it’s becoming complex. In algorithmic terms: if after an apparent ABC, the next swing doesn’t behave impulsively or breaks beyond the pattern’s start, prepare for an X-wave and another correction.

If an X-wave is detected (by partial retracement and then a reversal in the same direction as original correction), link patterns accordingly. The second pattern will be determined similarly by its initial leg: if the second phase starts with a 5-wave drop, it’s likely a zigzag or zigzag portion; if starts sideways, maybe a flat or triangle.

Prioritize by likelihood: Historically, Zigzags are the most common simple correction, then Flats, then Triangles. So if multiple fits are possible, zigzag is often Plan A. For instance, a 3-wave drop could be zigzag or part of a flat’s A-wave; the difference is in B. If B is small, it’s zigzag; if B is large, becomes flat. The algorithm can initially assume zigzag until B disproves by exceeding 61.8% (then switch to flat logic).

Triangle vs complex flat: sometimes after A-B-C, one might confuse a developing triangle with a double three. Key difference: triangle’s D will not exceed A or C extremes by much, whereas a new corrective pattern linked by X might break beyond A’s range. Also triangle will have five parts, whereas double three has two distinct ABC sections separated by X. The program can monitor wave count: if after C, the market does not produce a strong impulse (so correction not over) but instead makes a modest wave D that stays in range, treat it as triangle formation rather than labeling it X yet. Only if after C a larger retracement occurs (say 50% or more of entire ABC) one would label that move as X connecting to another pattern.

Elimination Checklist for Ambiguities: NEoWave strongly employs invalidation to eliminate incorrect interpretations:

If a pattern could be either a zigzag or part of a larger flat, use quantitative limits: e.g., does wave A retrace over 61.8% of prior impulse? If yes, zigzag pattern’s rule 1 fails (A too deep relative to prior impulse), lean toward flat.

If something looks like a triangle vs a combination: check wave lengths – triangle demands all sub-waves < prior; if one connecting wave breaks prior extreme substantially, likely not a triangle.

Many ambiguous cases are resolved by applying the logic rules at each step: For example, if only one confirmation stage out of two triggers, consider alternate count.

Power Ratings (Pattern Likelihood): Neely sometimes discussed a “power rating” to rank pattern plausibility. For instance, in practice, simple patterns are favored unless complexity is necessary. An impulse count usually has higher “power” (i.e., simpler explanation) than a complex correction count for the same segment – unless a rule forbids the impulse. The algorithm can be coded to choose the interpretation with the fewest pattern pieces that satisfies all rules (Occam’s razor principle). In other words, prefer the simplest pattern that is not invalidated by any rule. Only escalate to double or triple threes if a single-pattern interpretation fails all tests.

Most Common Patterns in Practice: In real markets, certain patterns occur more frequently. Neely observed zigzags and flats are far more common corrections than complex doubles/triples. Triangles are common in 4th wave positions and as B-waves. Impulses (especially with extended wave 3) are the norm for strong trends. Thus, the algorithm’s search order might reflect this:

Check impulse (trend) – common in strong moves.

If corrective: check zigzag first (sharp correction assumption).

If zigzag fails (e.g., B too high): consider flat next.

If pattern is lengthy sideways: consider triangle.

If none of single patterns fit fully and multiple segments identified: consider combination (double three).

Only if still not fitting, consider triple three (very rare).
Additionally, Running flats/triangles (where the market trend resumes before correction makes a new extreme) are somewhat less common, but must be recognized to avoid miscounting them as incomplete patterns. The software should be aware that a correction can end without hitting a new extreme (B beyond A or C not reaching A’s start), which is why the rules for “failure” patterns exist and those thresholds (C < 100% of B, etc.) are baked in

.

Final Labeling and Verification: Once a pattern is identified by satisfying all sub-rules, label the waves accordingly (1-5 for impulse, A-E for triangle, etc.). Then double-check “invalidations” one more time on the final count – e.g., measure that no adjacent same-degree waves flunk the 1/3 balance test, ensure all internal legs obey their own degree rules (like subwaves of an impulse also obeying impulse rules recursively), and confirm that the next larger wave (if pattern is a part of one) obeys rules relative to this pattern (e.g., if we labeled a wave-2 as a flat, does it retrace at least 10% of wave-1? etc., usually yes). This end verification ensures consistency across degrees.

By following this structured priority (impulse first, then simplest corrections to complex) and eliminating via strict criteria, the NEoWave approach yields a single most likely wave count out of the many possibilities. The result is a fully-labeled wave model that has survived all invalidation tests – meaning any deviation from that count would violate one or more rules, thus the count is as “proven” as possible until new market action might force revision.
